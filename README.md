# React App

A modern React application built with Vite and TypeScript as part of the Code with Mosh React course.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **React 18** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript** - Typed superset of JavaScript
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **CSS3** - Modern styling

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd react-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## 🔧 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode using Vite.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**To stop the development server:** Press `Ctrl + C` (or `Cmd + C` on macOS) in the terminal where the server is running.

**To force close the port 5173 (if needed):**

```bash
# Find the process using port 5173
lsof -ti:5173

# Kill the process using port 5173
kill -9 $(lsof -ti:5173)
```

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### `npm run preview`

Locally preview the production build.

### `npm run kill-port`

Forcefully stops any process running on port 5173 (the default Vite development server port).\
This is useful when the development server doesn't stop properly or the port remains occupied.
